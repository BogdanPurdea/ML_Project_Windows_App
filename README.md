# RBFN Food Quality Classifier (C# WinForms)

A robust **Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)** built entirely **from scratch** in C# to classify food items as "Healthy" or "Unhealthy" based on nutritional content. This project demonstrates a hybrid training pipeline (K-Means + Gradient Descent) without relying on external ML libraries like TensorFlow or ML.NET for the core algorithm.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **From-Scratch Implementation:** The entire Neural Network logic (Forward Pass, Backpropagation, Activation Functions) is hand-coded in C#.
* **Hybrid Training Algorithm:**
    * **Unsupervised Phase:** K-Means Clustering determines hidden neuron centroids.
    * **Heuristic Phase:** Sigma ($\sigma$) values calculated via average centroid distance.
    * **Supervised Phase:** Gradient Descent optimizes output weights using a Sigmoid activation.
* **Dynamic Data Loading:** Capable of parsing CSVs with customizable schemas (column selection) at runtime.
* **Persistent Models:** Trains models and saves weights, stats, and schemas to a local SQLite database (`food_classifier.db`).
* **Data Normalization:** Built-in Z-Score normalization pipeline ensures statistical stability.

## 🧠 Model Architecture: RBF Neural Network

The model is a 3-layer feed-forward network tailored for binary classification.

### 1. Input Layer
Accepts a vector of nutritional features. The dimension is dynamic based on user selection (e.g., Protein, Fat, Sugar, etc.).
* **Preprocessing:** All inputs are Z-Score normalized before entering the network:
    $$x_{norm} = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

### 2. Hidden Layer (RBF Kernels)
Instead of standard dot-product neurons, this layer uses **Gaussian Radial Basis Functions**. Each neuron acts as a prototype for a specific cluster of data.
* **Activation Function:** Gaussian
    $$\phi(x) = e^{-\frac{||x - c||^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
    * $x$: Input vector
    * $c$: Centroid (learned via K-Means)
    * $\sigma$: Spread/Width of the Gaussian

### 3. Output Layer (Logistic Regression)
A single neuron aggregates the RBF activations to produce a probability score (0 to 1).
* **Aggregation:** Linear weighted sum of hidden outputs + bias.
* **Activation Function:** Sigmoid
    $$y = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\sum (w_i \cdot \phi_i) + b}}$$

## 📂 Code Structure & Implementation

The core logic is isolated in the `Source` folder, separating the math from the WinForms UI.

### 🔹 Core ML Engine
* **`RbfNetwork.cs`**: The data structure holding Centroids, Sigmas, and Weights. Contains the `Forward()` method for prediction.
* **`RbfTrainer.cs`**: Orchestrates the training pipeline:
    1.  Runs **K-Means** to find centroids ($c$).
    2.  Computes standard deviation for $\sigma$.
    3.  Runs **Gradient Descent** to minimize Squared Error on the output weights.
* **`FoodClassifier.cs`**: A high-level wrapper that combines the `RbfNetwork` with `NormalizationStats`. This ensures that any raw input provided by the user is automatically normalized using the *exact* stats from the training set before prediction.

### 🔹 Data Management
* **`DataLoader.cs`**: Dynamically parses CSV files based on a user-defined schema string (e.g., `"PROTEIN;FAT;CLASS"`).
* **`NormalizationHelper.cs`**: math utility for computing Means and Standard Deviations (Z-Scores) and serializing them for storage.
* **`ModelRepository.cs`**: Handles SQLite operations using Entity Framework Core to save/load trained models.
