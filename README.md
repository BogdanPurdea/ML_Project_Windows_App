# RBFN Food Quality Classifier (C# WinForms)

A robust **Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)** built entirely **from scratch** in C# to classify food items as "Healthy" or "Unhealthy" based on nutritional content. This project demonstrates a hybrid training pipeline (K-Means + Gradient Descent) without relying on external ML libraries like TensorFlow or ML.NET for the core algorithm.

## 🧠 Model Architecture: RBF Neural Network

The model is a 3-layer feed-forward network tailored for binary classification, implemented from scratch without external ML frameworks.

### 1. Input Layer
Accepts a vector of nutritional features. The dimension is dynamic based on user selection (e.g., Protein, Fat, Sugar, etc.).
* **Preprocessing:** All inputs are Z-Score normalized before entering the network to prevent neuron saturation:
    $$x_{norm} = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

### 2. Hidden Layer (RBF Kernels)
Instead of standard dot-product neurons, this layer uses **Gaussian Radial Basis Functions**. Each neuron acts as a local prototype for a specific region of the feature space.
* **Activation Function:** Gaussian
    $$\phi_j(x) = e^{-\frac{||x - \mu_j||^2}{2\sigma_j^2}}$$
    * $x$: Input vector
    * $\mu_j$: Centroid vector (learned via Unsupervised K-Means)
    * $\sigma_j$: Spread/Width (learned via **K-Nearest Neighbors** heuristic)

### 3. Output Layer (Probabilistic Classification)
A single neuron aggregates the RBF activations to produce a probability score (0 to 1).
* **Aggregation:** Linear weighted sum of hidden outputs + bias.
* **Activation Function:** Sigmoid
    $$y = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\sum w_j \phi_j(x) + b)}}$$

### 🚀 Hybrid Training Strategy

The network is trained in three distinct phases to optimize performance:

1.  **Unsupervised Clustering (Centroids):** Uses **K-Means Clustering** to position RBF centroids ($\mu$) at the centers of data density.
2.  **Statistical Heuristic (Sigmas):** Uses a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** rule ($k=2$) to calculate the spread ($\sigma$). This ensures smooth overlap between neurons, preventing gaps in the decision boundary.
3.  **Supervised Learning (Weights):** The output weights are trained using **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with Momentum** ($\alpha=0.9$) to minimize **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**, ensuring high recall and faster convergence.

## 📂 Code Structure & Implementation

The core logic is isolated in the `Source` folder, separating the math from the WinForms UI.

### 🔹 Core ML Engine
* **`RbfNetwork.cs`**: The data structure holding Centroids, Sigmas, and Weights. Contains the `Forward()` method for prediction.
* **`DecisionTree.cs`**: Recursive structure for regression trees, supporting custom split criteria.
* **`RbfTrainer.cs`**: Orchestrates the training pipeline:
    1.  Runs **K-Means** to find centroids ($c$).
    2.  Computes standard deviation for $\sigma$.
    3.  Runs **Gradient Descent** to minimize Squared Error on the output weights.
* **`FoodClassifier.cs`**: A high-level wrapper that combines the `RbfNetwork` with `NormalizationStats`. This ensures that any raw input provided by the user is automatically normalized using the *exact* stats from the training set before prediction.
* **`LimeExplainer.cs`**: Generates local perturbations to explain model predictions (LIME).
* **`GridSearchOptimizer.cs`**: Performs exhaustive search over hyperparameter grids using Cross-Validation.

### 🔹 Data Management
* **`DataLoader.cs`**: Dynamically parses CSV files based on a user-defined schema string (e.g., `"energy_kcal;protein_g;carbohydrate_g;sugar_g;total_fat_g;sat_fat_g;fiber_g;salt_g;is_healthy"`).
* **`NormalizationHelper.cs`**: math utility for computing Means and Standard Deviations (Z-Scores) and serializing them for storage.
* **`ModelRepository.cs`**: Handles SQLite operations using Entity Framework Core to save/load trained models.

### 🔹 Console Runner
* **`Program.cs`**: A CLI entry point for running the application in console mode.
